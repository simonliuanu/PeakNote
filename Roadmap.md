**Week 9: Deep Dive into User Needs & Core Features (May 1)**

- **Goal:** Solidify understanding of *who* will use PeakNote and *what* core problems it solves for them. Explore different UI directions. Update User Manual to show how to import meeting records.
- **Activities**:
  - Present sprint 2 documentations with tutor in sprint review
  - Update User Stories & Personas for the most critical features discussed so far. Work out MVP
  - Update user manual to show how to import Teams meeting url
- **Client Meeting:** Present the Personas, User Stories, personas & MVP, and the updated UI concepts. Get feedback on which persona resonates most, which user stories are highest priority. Present updated user manual.

**Week 10: Refine & Select UI Direction, Finalise Core Features (May 8)**

- **Goal:** Lock down the core feature list for this semester's focus and select the final UI design direction based on last week's feedback.
- Activities:
  - Refine the User Stories & MVP based on client feedback, clearly defining the scope for the initial front-end build.
  - Develop finalised higher-fidelity mockups (or even a simple clickable prototype) for the *chosen* UI direction. Show key screens and interactions.
  - Document the agreed-upon feature set and the finalized UI design rationale.
- **Client Meeting:** Present the finalised User Stories and the detailed mockups/prototype of the chosen UI. Seek formal agreement/sign-off from the client: "Does this accurately represent the core features and the look-and-feel we should build for PeakNote first?"

**Week 11: Foundational Front-End Implementation (May 15)**

- **Goal:** Start translating the approved design into actual code, focusing on the main structure and key components.
- Activities:
  - Set up the front-end project structure (e.g., framework choice, folders, basic build setup).
  - Start coding the main application shell/layout based on the mockups.
  - Implement 1-2 key UI components (e.g., the main meeting view, a specific button panel, input fields) visually.
- **Client Meeting:** Demonstrate the initial coded structure and the implemented components. Show how the design is starting to come to life. Get feedback on the visual implementation. Ask: "How does seeing the design in code feel? Any immediate adjustments needed?"

**Week 12: Implement Key Interaction & Semester Wrap-up (May 22)**

- **Goal:** Implement a core user interaction flow within the UI and prepare for the end-of-semester presentation/handover.
- Activities:
  - Continue implementing UI components based on priority.
  - Focus on making one key user story partially interactive within the UI (even if it's just simulated front-end logic for now).
  - Prepare final documentation (updated designs, user stories, code overview).
  - Prepare the final presentation/demo for the client and course assessment.
  - Prepare the roadmap for next semester's sprint 1
- **Client Meeting:** Present the final progress for the semester. Demo the implemented UI, focusing on the interactive flow you built. Discuss the achievements and hand over documentation. Get final feedback and briefly discuss the plan for next semester's backend work. Discuss the roadmap for semester 2 sprint 1.
